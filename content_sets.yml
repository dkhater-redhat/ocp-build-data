# This is a file defining which content sets (yum repositories) are needed to
# update content in this image. Data provided here helps determine which images
# are vulnerable to specific CVEs. Generally you should only need to update this
# file when:
#    1. You start depending on a new product
#    2. You are preparing new product release and your content sets will change
#
# See https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/container-build-system/container_build_system_wiki/guide_to_layered_image_build_service_osbs
# for more information on maintaining this file and the format and examples.
#
# You should have one top level item for each architecture being built. Most
# likely this will be x86_64 and ppc64le initially.
